      <p className="mb-2">
        PumpSync is a simple solution for editing Pump it Up gameplay videos.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        You can upload a video of someone playing Pump it Up, possibly with
        noisy background audio, and an youtube link that points to a video with
        the music that is played in the gameplay, and we will try our best to
        locate that audio in the video, overwrite it, and send it back to you.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        It also supports youtube videos with some menu screen and score screen UI audio before
        and after the music (e.g NEVSISTER videos). 

        The service will try to locate those and trim them out, if the UI happens to be fom XX or Phoenix.

        This project is still early in development, so you can expect plenty of
        bugs and a lot of downtime.
